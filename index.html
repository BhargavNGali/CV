  <p>Currently a senior at Western Michigan University double majoring in
    Computer science and Data science. Graduating in Fall(December) 2023, I am
    eager to secure challenging roles in a field of Computer Science and Data
    Science. My studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of
    computer science, tools, software packages and techniques. Alongside this,
    I have developed sound communication skills while delivering presentations
    to groups of audiences at my public speaking class. As such, I am confident
    that I can make an instant impact in roles I am offered. I am eager to hear
    about potential career opportunities and internships, so I would be pleased
    to chat about job openings in the computer science and data science sphere.</p>
